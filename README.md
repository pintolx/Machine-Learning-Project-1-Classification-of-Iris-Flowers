# Machine-Learning-Project-1-Classification-of-Iris-Flowers
This project is an end to end working through of a machine learning project of classification of Iris flowers.
This is my first machine learning project, which goes through all the steps from loading the dataset, summarizing the data, visualizing the data, evaluating some algorithms and presenting findings after training.
